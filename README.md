## MPIDR Workshop on Working with and Visualizing Geographic Data

This repo contains the following:

* Slides from the presentation portion of the workshop
* A .yml file to load an environment that will work with the code
* A jupyter notebook with code covering some of the concepts covered in the presentation
* All the data needed to run the code in the jupyter notebook

I strongly recommend using the .yml file because the geopandas package is a pain to install because it uses GDAL as a dependency. All the necessary packages should be loaded in the .yml file.

Thanks for coming to my presentation/workshop and I hope you find this information useful. You are welcome to reach out with any questions by emailing me at seanreid@ucsb.edu
